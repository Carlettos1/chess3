# Player
A player have multiple data asociated.

* max_movements: 1, increments with cards and abilities.
* movements: 1, decreases for every movement of the player, it reset to max_movements at turn start.
* max_mana: 2, increments with cards, and every 5 turns.
* mana: 2, decreases when used, increses by 1 up to max_mana at turn start.
* id: String
* starting_hand: Hand
* starting_deck: Deck
* current_hand: Hand
* current_deck: Deck
* central_deck: Deck

# Board
Main container of the game. It should update everything accordingly.

* board: List of Squares
* death_pile: DeathPile
* common_deck: Deck
* cards_on_board: PlayedCard
* Players: List of Player
* Direction: List of Directions for the patterns to use (like Up, Down)
* time: ChessTime
* rng: ChessRandom
* events: List of Event

# ChessTime
Its composed by 3 numbers: rounds, turn, movement. On a normal 1 vs 1 there is a lot of redundancy but the system is made for abstraction, not on this specific case. Most things are counted in rounds, but there are exceptions. All time elements (cooldown, cast time, etc) are in this ChessTime and should be updated accordingly. The board will contain a function that's called on_movement, on_turn and on_round, for simplicity's sake.

* round: 0, adds 1 every round
* turn: 0, adds 1 every turn, reset to 0 at round end
* movement: 0, adds 1 every movement, reset to 0 at turn end

# ChessRandom
Its composed by 3 numbers, round_rng, turn_rng and movement_rng. They are updated accordingly on the board.

* round_rng: Rng
* turn_rng: Rng
* movement_rng: Rng

# Card
It contains the info of the card. The id is used to get its Name, Description and other localization stuff.

* id: String
* mana_cost: int

# PlayedCard
It contains a Card, and the id of the player that played it.

* card: Card
* player_id: String

# Deck and Hand
They are the same struct, but named different for natural intuition. You should be able to take, see, put, remove cards individually or in a collection. It should also have a method to see if it has a specific card or a group of cards.

* cards: List of Cards

# Square
The chess square.

* magic: bool, if it is magic or not (for portal building allowance), default false
* pos: Position, the position on the board, given at constructing it, needed
* piece: Optional of Piece, the piece on the Square, default None

# DeathPile
A list of death pieces. Every dead piece should go to here.

* pieces: List of Pieces (with color in it)

# Event
An event to occur in the board, it will be expanded later.

* player_id: String
* when: ChessTime, it is reduced on tick
* event_function: EventFunctionEnum

# EventFunctionEnum
Lazy way to implement (not so) generic functions and not worrying about lifetimes. Currently I only care about these things

* Summon(Piece)
* AddMana
* AddMovement
* ApplyEffect(Position)

# Position
just x, y coordinates. It can be constructed from Axis, Dir and SubDir

* x: int
* y: int

# Axis
1 X
2 Y

# Directions (Dir for short)
1 Up    (x: 0, y: +1) (Axis: Y)
2 Right (x: +1, y: 0) (Axis: X)
3 Down  (x: 0, y: -1) (Axis: Y)
4 Left  (x: -1, y: 0) (Axis: X)

# SubDirection (SubDir for short)
1 Up        (Up)
2 UpRight   (Up + Right)
3 Right     (Right)
4 DownRight (Down + Right)
5 Down      (Down)
6 DownLeft  (Down + Left)
7 Left      (Left)
8 UpLeft    (Up + Left)

Any non Direction Subdirection is considered Diagonal

# Patterns

Every Pattern receives a StartPoint and an EndPoint and returns true if the Points Matches the Pattern. The patterns can ask for extra data, and they might need the board state to check if there are any p√≠eces in the way. The patterns can include or exclude the last square containing a piece depending if the pattern is used to check an Action::Take (includes) or an Action::Move (excludes). Notice that attack also includes pieces in the pattern matching.

The description is: (number_of_squares, can_go_through_pieces, Axis/Dir/SubDir/Diagonal/All, other notes). 
if number_of_squares is -1, then is infinite
